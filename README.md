# Super Pong

SUPER PONG adds onto the classic game by introducting a host of new powerups, including the TRIPLE, the SUPERSIZER, and the GUARD. But don't worry - the central mechanics of Pong are still intact, as two players aim to direct a white ball towards the other side.

This is a two player game; there is no limit on the number of points one can acquire, as the intention is for whatever pair of friends that happen to be playing the game to decide upon the game's length.
